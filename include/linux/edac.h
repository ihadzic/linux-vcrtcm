/*
 * There are several things to be aware of that aren't at all obvious:
 *
 *
 * SOCKETS, SOCKET SETS, BANKS, ROWS, CHIP-SELECT ROWS, CHANNELS, etc..
 *
 * These are some of the many terms that are thrown about that don't always
 * mean what people think they mean (Inconceivable!).  In the interest of
 * creating a common ground for discussion, terms and their definitions
 * will be established.
 *
 * Memory devices:	The individual chip on a memory stick.  These devices
 *			commonly output 4 and 8 bits each.  Grouping several
 *			of these in parallel provides 64 bits which is common
 *			for a memory stick.
 *
 * Memory Stick:	A printed circuit board that aggregates multiple
 *			memory devices in parallel.  This is the atomic
 *			memory component that is purchaseable by Joe consumer
 *			and loaded into a memory socket.
 *
 * Socket:		A physical connector on the motherboard that accepts
 *			a single memory stick.
 *
 * Channel:		Set of memory devices on a memory stick that must be
 *			grouped in parallel with one or more additional
 *			channels from other memory sticks.  This parallel
 *			grouping of the output from multiple channels are
 *			necessary for the smallest granularity of memory access.
 *			Some memory controllers are capable of single channel -
 *			which means that memory sticks can be loaded
 *			individually.  Other memory controllers are only
 *			capable of dual channel - which means that memory
 *			sticks must be loaded as pairs (see "socket set").
 *
 * Chip-select row:	All of the memory devices that are selected together.
 *			for a single, minimum grain of memory access.
 *			This selects all of the parallel memory devices across
 *			all of the parallel channels.  Common chip-select rows
 *			for single channel are 64 bits, for dual channel 128
 *			bits.
 *
 * Single-Ranked stick:	A Single-ranked stick has 1 chip-select row of memory.
 *			Motherboards commonly drive two chip-select pins to
 *			a memory stick. A single-ranked stick, will occupy
 *			only one of those rows. The other will be unused.
 *
 * Double-Ranked stick:	A double-ranked stick has two chip-select rows which
 *			access different sets of memory devices.  The two
 *			rows cannot be accessed concurrently.
 *
 * Double-sided stick:	DEPRECATED TERM, see Double-Ranked stick.
 *			A double-sided stick has two chip-select rows which
 *			access different sets of memory devices.  The two
 *			rows cannot be accessed concurrently.  "Double-sided"
 *			is irrespective of the memory devices being mounted
 *			on both sides of the memory stick.
 *
 * Socket set:		All of the memory sticks that are required for
 *			a single memory access or all of the memory sticks
 *			spanned by a chip-select row.  A single socket set
 *			has two chip-select rows and if double-sided sticks
 *			are used these will occupy those chip-select rows.
 *
 * Bank:		This term is avoided because it is unclear when
 *			needing to distinguish between chip-select rows and
 *			socket sets.
 *
 * Controller pages:
 *
 * Physical pages:
 *
 * Virtual pages:
 *
 *
 * STRUCTURE ORGANIZATION AND CHOICES
 *
 *
 *
 * PS - I enjoyed writing all that about as much as you enjoyed reading it.
