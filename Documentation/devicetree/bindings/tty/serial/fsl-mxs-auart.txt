* Freescale MXS Application UART (AUART)

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "fsl,<soc>-auart". The supported SoCs include
  imx23 and imx28.
- reg : Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts : Should contain the auart interrupt numbers

Optional properties:
- fsl,auart-dma-channel : The DMA channels, the first is for RX, the other
		is for TX. If you add this property, it also means that you
		will enable the DMA support for the auart.
		Note: due to the hardware bug in imx23(see errata : 2836),
		only the imx28 can enable the DMA support for the auart.

Example:
auart0: serial@8006a000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx28-auart", "fsl,imx23-auart";
	reg = <0x8006a000 0x2000>;
	interrupts = <112 70 71>;
	fsl,auart-dma-channel = <8 9>;
};

Note: Each auart port should have an alias correctly numbered in "aliases"
node.

Example:

aliases {
	serial0 = &auart0;
	serial1 = &auart1;
	serial2 = &auart2;
	serial3 = &auart3;
	serial4 = &auart4;
};
