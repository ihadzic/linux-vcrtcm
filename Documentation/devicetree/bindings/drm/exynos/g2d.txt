Samsung 2D Graphic Accelerator using DRM frame work

Samsung FIMG2D is a graphics 2D accelerator which supports Bit Block Transfer.
We set the drawing-context registers for configuring rendering parameters and
then start rendering.
This driver is for SOCs which contain G2D IPs with version 4.1.

Required properties:
	-compatible:
		should be "samsung,exynos-g2d-41".
	-reg:
		physical base address of the controller and length
		of memory mapped region.
	-interrupts:
		interrupt combiner values.

Example:
	g2d {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos-g2d-41";
		reg = <0x10850000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 91 0>;
	};
